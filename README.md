# Atmos_Column
A package to handle atmospheric "column" measurements like solar spectrometers, aircraft, and satellite remote sensing for use in models like STILT.

Create a conda environment from the yml file: <conda env create -f environment.yml>
Activate the conda environment: <conda activate atmos_column>

Useful descriptions of how the code works can be found in Viz_Dev.ipynb. This allows the user to walk through the slant column creation step by step. 

Contained in atmos_column are the ac_funcs.py module handling analysis routines, and plotting.py, handling plotting routines.
