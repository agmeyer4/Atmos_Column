The input_config.json (or whatever you name it) file is a JSON type file that contains
the configurations for running on your individual setup, as well as parameters necessary
to create the desired outputs. The format of this file should remain consistent, and variable
names should not be changed. Variable values can and should be changed to reflect your desired
outcome. These are described below. 

"column_type" : a string with current options 'em27' or 'ground'. Option 'ground' is the generic
    version, and will create slant receptors for a ground based sensor given the in put params. 
    Option 'em27' will pull data from linked oof files to gather instrument location and timing 
    data for the run. 

"interval" : a string with synatx matching python's "freq" ('2H' = 2 hours, '5T' = 5 minutes). 
    This option will define the interval between start and end datetiems at which to create slant 
    column receptors. 

"start_dt_str" : string of form datetime ('YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS') from which to start the run. 

"end_dt_str" : string of form datetime ('YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS') at which to end the run 

"timezone" : string of python timezone type ('UTC', 'US/Mountain') on which to operate. 
    This should usually be 'UTC', as EM27 data is often collected in 'UTC' time and working in UTC
    time eliminates misunderstandings. 

"inst_lat" : float decimal latitude of the instrument. Will be overwritten if column_type='em27', 
    as location data is garnered from oof files in this case. 

"inst_lon" : float decimal longitude of the instrument. Will be overwritten if column_type='em27', 
    as location data is garnered from oof files in this case. 

"inst_zasl" : float decimal elevation in meters above sea level of the instrument. Will be overwritten 
    if column_type='em27', as location data is garnered from oof files in this case. 

"folder_paths": dict containing important folder paths.
    "base_project_folder" : path to folder containing the Atmos_Column git repo, data, and STILT dirs. 
    "column_data_folder" : location of total column data, such as a collection of oof files
    "hrrr_data_folder" : location of HRRR data for STILT runs 
    "output_data_folder" : location where output should be stored
    "stilt_folder" : location where STILT runs should be carried out. Helpful to have this outside the git
        repo. 

"z_ail_list" : list of integers representing the heights above the instrument level (ail) at which to place receptors

"backtraj_hours" : how long to run the backtrajectories in STILT

"hrrr_subset_datestr" : string of datetime form (YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM) representing the datetime from which to pull
    surface subset data. 

"met_model_type" : string representing what kind of met data to use in STILT. Currently only option is 'hrrr' and is unused

"met_product" : string representation of the met product such as 'nat' in hrrr. Currently unused. 

"cores" : int or 'max'. If int, config will use that many cores (provided there are enough) to parallelize STILT
    runs. If 'max', config will use all of the available cores to run STILT in parallel. 

"run_stilt_configs" : dict for changing STILT run configuration settings. Keys must match the user-settable
    values in run_stilt.r of the STILT setup. These values will be input into the modified run_stilt.r configuration
    during stilt_setup.py.
